### 1. [Cognitive Adaptive Equalizer (EQx)](./AI/cognitive-adaptive-equalizer)

**Summary**:  
EQx is a conceptual AI system designed to function like a cognitive equalizer, modulating emotionally charged input (e.g., emails, social media) in real-time to reduce psychological harm while preserving semantic content. Inspired by signal processing, EQx reframes emotionally intense stimuli to mitigate cognitive overload, improve emotional regulation, and reduce stress-related crises.

- **Focus**: Emotion-aware AI, reinforcement learning, LLM-mediated smoothing
- **Research Method**: Two-phase simulation using Reddit/X data and surrogate agent responses
- **Applications**: Messaging filters, mental health support bots, therapist tools, digital wellness platforms
- **Ethical Consideration**: No human testing in early phases, public data only, opt-in transparency in later phases
